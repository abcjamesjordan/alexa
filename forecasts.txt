On Saturday, we'll see a short break in the snow midday. From Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, an additional 4-24+ inches will accumulate. For next week, two more storms will keep the powder party going. \nShort Term Forecast\nIf you like snow more than you like reading, the short, short, short version of this post is that it's going to snow from Friday through Sunday with soft snow for most mountains, deep powder for a few spots, and more snow continuing into next week. This is a great weather pattern and here is the NWS 10-to-1 ratio snow forecast from Friday through Sunday to prove it (actual 3-day totals could vary of course, but overall it's a great-looking graphic if you like snow).\n\nRecap: Thursday & Thursday Night\nLight showers brought a coating to 2 inches to most spots while Steamboat received more snow with 4-6 inches across the mountain.\nStorm #1: Friday & Friday Night\nOn Friday, the storm will bring snow throughout the day with 2-6 inches for many spots and conditions getting softer through the day.\n\nOn Friday night, snow should continue especially in the central and northern mountains with an additional 2-6 inches. I have low confidence in the area that will see the most snow, but with showers continuing overnight, this should mean that Saturday morning will also be soft.\n\nBreak: Saturday\nIn the morning we will see snow wind down, then snow should stop for a few hours during the middle of the day, then snow will ramp back up by late afternoon. The snow on the map below is the combination of light amounts on both Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\nStorm #2: Saturday Night & Sunday\nOn Saturday night, snow will favor the far southern mountains with 8-18 inches. The far southern mountains will see the most snow because storm energy will track over this region and the wind direction will be favorable, from the southwest. For other areas, I have very, very low confidence as there will be enough storm energy to create snow but the wind direction will not be favorable, and this competition between favorable and unfavorable factors is what leads to low confidence in the forecast.\n\nOn Sunday, snow showers will continue and most mountains should see at least a few more inches with potentially 6+ additional inches in the southern mountains. Sunday should offer deep powder in the south and at least soft conditions for most other spots.\n\nExtended Forecast\nNext week (Feb 15-19) and the following weekend (Feb 20-21) are going to be active with three possible storms across these seven days.\nThe first storm could be from Monday through Thursday morning. Snowfall may not be intense, but snow falling across multiple days could lead to soft/fun conditions throughout the week.\nThe second storm could be from Friday through Saturday (Feb 19-20).\nThe third storm could be from Sunday into Monday (Feb 21-22).\nThe second and third storms are too far away to discuss details yet. Stay tuned.\nOverall it's great to see storms in the forecast every few days and I hope that you are currently or soon get to enjoy the powder.\nThanks for reading!\nJOEL GRATZ\nAnnouncements\nBackcountry\nIf you've seen pictures of backcountry riding in fresh powder, and it looks appealing, please remember that going into the backcountry is awesome AND requires education if you're going to enjoy it safely and respectfully.\nThis is a great place to start to find out more about taking educational classes, hiring guides, and in general, to learn how to get into the backcountry and have a ton of fun and do so safely: https://www.colorado.com/WinterBackcountrySafety\nGeography Key\nNorthern MountainsSteamboat, Granby, Beaver Creek, Vail, Ski Cooper, Copper, Breckenridge, Keystone, Loveland, Arapahoe Basin, Winter Park, Berthoud Pass, Eldora, Rocky Mountain National Park, Cameron Pass\nAlong the DivideLoveland, Arapahoe Basin, Winter Park, Berthoud Pass\nEast of the DivideEldora, Echo, Rocky Mountain National Park, Cameron Pass\nCentral MountainsAspen, Sunlight, Monarch, Crested Butte, Irwin, Powderhorn\nSouthern MountainsTelluride, Silverton \u2013 north side of the southern mountains | Purgatory, Wolf Creek \u2013 south side of the southern mountains\n",

The Oregon Cascades in particular will be slammed with huge snow totals expected this weekend and early next week. The OpenSnow 5-Day Forecast calls for 91 inches of snow at Timberline (near Mt. Hood) through Tuesday!\n\nForecast for Fri, Feb 12\nA storm will continue to impact the West on Friday with heavy snow for the Sierras, Southern Cascades, and portions of the Central Rockies. Lingering snow across the Mid-Atlantic on Friday morning will taper off by the afternoon.\n\nForecast for Sat, Feb 13 \u2013 Sun, Feb 14\nAnother strong storm will impact the West on Saturday and Sunday with the heaviest snow expected in the Cascades and Central/Southern Rockies. Snow levels will be down to sea level for parts of the Northwest on Saturday. A storm will also impact the Northeast on Saturday and Sunday with freezing rain mixing in as far north as Central Pennsylvania and Northern New Jersey.\u00a0\n\nForecast for Mon, Feb 15 \u2013 Wed, Feb 17\nThe storm train continues with another good storm for the West on Monday and Tuesday that will impact most mountain areas south of the US/Canada border. The Northwest will be favored for the deepest totals again.\u00a0\nA powerful storm is also expected in the East on Monday and Tuesday with precipitation expected to remain all-snow in New England while freezing rain could fall as far north as Central/Eastern Pennsylvania (exact location subject to change this far out of course).\nMost of North America should see a relative lull on Wednesday with lingering snow tapering off in New England while light snow showers will remain possible in the Rockies.\n\nExtended Forecast\nOutlook for Thu, Feb 18 \u2013 Mon, Feb 22\nAn active pattern will continue across North America with a slight northward trend in the storm track expected in the West, which should allow Canada to get back in on the action after a relatively quiet period recently. Additional storms are likely for the East as well.\n\nThanks so much for reading! Check back for my next post on Monday, February 15th.\nALAN SMITH\n",
